        /*
        âœ… Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern
ðŸ”¹ Encapsulates object creation logic â€“ The client does not need to know concrete class names.
ðŸ”¹ Supports multiple families of products â€“ Easily switch between different product families.
ðŸ”¹ Ensures consistency â€“ Only compatible products are created together.
ðŸ”¹ Follows Dependency Inversion Principle â€“ Clients depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
